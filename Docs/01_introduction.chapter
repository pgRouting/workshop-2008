== Abstract ==

pgRouting adds routing functionality to PostGIS. This introductory workshop 
will show you how. It gives a practical example of how to use pgRouting with 
OpenStreetMap road network data. It explains the steps to prepare the network 
data, make routing queries, assign costs to the network links and modify your 
results through wrapper functions.
